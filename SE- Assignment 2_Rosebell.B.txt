Q1 Define software Engineering
Software Engineering is a branch of computer Science that deals with design, development, testing and maintenance of software applications.

 
Q2 What is software engineering, and how does it differ from traditional programming?
A It is the process of building and designing something that serves a particular purpose and finds a cost effective solution to the problem.
Software engineering differs from traditional programing because it is mainly used for large projects based on software systems rather than single programs or applications. In addition, it is a systematic disciplined approach to software development that aims to create high quality, reliable and maintainable software.

Q3 Software Development Life Cycle (SDLC):Explain the various phases of the Software Development Life Cycle.
Software Development Life Cycle (SDLC) Is a structured process is used to design, develop and test good high quality software that meet user requirements. The various phases of SDLC include:
stage 1 : planning and Requirement analysis: in this stage, basic project is designed with all the available information such us requirements from stakeholders, feasibility of creating the product, revenue potential, cost of production. Once it is decided that the software project is in line with the business and stakeholder goals, feasibility to create and address user needs, then we move to the next phase.  
stage 2 : Defining requirements. In this stage, all the requirements for the software are specified, these requirements get approval from stakeholders. this is fulfilled by utilizing software requirement specifications- a document that specifies all the things that need to be created during the entire project life cycle.

Stage 3 Implementation (Coding): The actual code for the software is written during this phase. Developers follow the design documents to create functional software components.

Stage 4 Testing: After coding, the software is thoroughly tested to identify and fix defects. Testing ensures that the software functions as intended and meets the specified requirements.

Stage 5 Deployment: Once the software has been tested and is free of critical issues, it is deployed to a production environment where it can be accessed and used by end-users.

Stage 6 Maintenance: After deployment, the software enters the maintenance phase. This involves updating the software to fix bugs, improve performance, or adapt to changes in the environment.



Q4 Agile vs. Waterfall Models: Compare and contrast the Agile and Waterfall models of software development. What are the key differences, and in what scenarios might each be preferred? Requirements Engineering:
Agile Model:is an iterative and incremental model that emphasizes flexibility, customer collaboration, and rapid delivery of functional software. It breaks down the project into small, manageable units called "sprints" or "iterations," with each sprint delivering a potentially shippable product.
Key Features:
Flexibility: Changes can be made at any point during the development process.
Customer Collaboration: Continuous involvement of stakeholders and customers.
Iterative Development: Regular releases of working software.

Comparison to waterfall
Client input is required throughout the product development.
Changes can be made at any stage.
Coordination among project teams is required to ensure correctness.
It is really useful in large and complex projects.
The testing part can be started before the development of the entire product.
A Small team is sufficient for Agile project management.
The cost of development is less.
It completes the project in comparatively less time.
The Agile Method is known for its flexibility.
After each sprint/cycle test plan is discussed.
 


Waterfall Model:is a linear and sequential approach where each phase of the SDLC must be completed before the next one begins. It is a more traditional model where requirements are gathered upfront, and changes are difficult to implement once the process has started.
Key Features:
Structured Approach: Follows a strict sequence of phases.
Clear Documentation: Comprehensive documentation at each stage.
Less Flexibility: Limited scope for changes once a phase is completed.

Comparison to agile
Client input is required only after completing each phase.
Changes cannot be made after the completion of a phase.
Coordination is not needed as one team starts the work after the finish of another team.
It is mainly used for small project development.
Testing can only be performed when the complete product is ready.
It requires a large team.
The cost of development is high.
It takes more time compared to Agile.
The waterfall Method is a structured software development methodology so it is quite rigid.
Hardly any test plan is discussed during a cycle.


Q5 Requirements management is the process of managing the requirements throughout the software development life cycle, including tracking and controlling changes, and ensuring that the requirements are still valid and relevant. The goal of requirements management is to ensure that the software system being developed meets the needs and expectations of the stakeholders and that it is developed on time, within budget, and to the required quality.

Several key activities are involved in requirements management, including:

Tracking and controlling changes: This involves monitoring and controlling changes to the requirements throughout the development process, including identifying the source of the change, assessing the impact of the change, and approving or rejecting the change.
Version control: This involves keeping track of different versions of the requirements document and other related artifacts.
Traceability: This involves linking the requirements to other elements of the development process, such as design, testing, and validation.
Communication: This involves ensuring that the requirements are communicated effectively to all stakeholders and that any changes or issues are addressed promptly.
Monitoring and reporting: This involves monitoring the progress of the development process and reporting on the status of the requirements.
Requirements management is a critical step in the software development life cycle as it helps to ensure that the software system being developed meets the needs and expectations of stakeholders and that it is developed on time, within budget, and to the required quality. It also helps to prevent scope creep and to ensure that the requirements are aligned with the project goals.

Q6 Explain the concept of modularity in software design. How does it improve maintainability and scalability of software systems?   Concept of Modularity:
Modularity refers to the design technique of breaking down a software system into smaller, manageable, and self-contained units called modules. Each module encapsulates a specific functionality and can be developed, tested, and maintained independently of other modules.Some of the projects or software designs are very complex that it’s not easy to understand its working and functioning. In such cases, modularity is a key weapon that helps in reducing the complexity of such software or projects. The basic principle of Modularity is that “Systems should be built from cohesive, loosely coupled components (modules)” which means s system should be made up of different components that are united and work together in an efficient way and such components have a well-defined function.

Improving Maintainability and Scalability:

Maintainability: Modularity enhances maintainability by isolating changes. When a module requires updates or bug fixes, modifications can be made without affecting other parts of the system. This isolation reduces the risk of introducing new errors during maintenance.
Scalability: Modularity facilitates scalability by allowing developers to add new modules or update existing ones without impacting the entire system. This flexibility supports the system's growth and adaptation to new requirements.

Q7 Describe the different levels of software testing (unit testing, integration testing, system testing, acceptance testing). Why is testing crucial in software development?

Levels of Software Testing:

Unit Testing: The process of checking small pieces of code to ensure that the individual parts of the program work properly on their own 
Tests individual units or components of a software.
Ensures that each unit functions correctly in isolation.
Usually performed by developers.

Integration Testing: a type of software testing in which the different units, modules or components of a software application are tested as a combined entity. 
Tests the interaction between integrated units/modules.
Identifies issues in the interfaces and interaction between modules.
Can be conducted by developers or testers.

System Testing:System testing is a type of software testing that evaluates the overall functionality and performance of a complete and fully integrated software solution. It tests if the system meets the specified requirements and if it is suitable for delivery to the end-users.
Tests the complete and integrated software system.
Verifies that the system meets the specified requirements.
Conducted by testers.

Acceptance Testing:Acceptance Testing is an important aspect of Software Testing, which guarantees that software aligns with user needs and business requirements. The major aim of this test is to evaluate the compliance of the system with the business requirements and assess whether it is acceptable for delivery or not.
Validates the software against business requirements.
Performed by end-users or clients to ensure the software meets their needs.
Includes user acceptance testing (UAT).
Importance of Testing:

Detection of Defects: Identifies bugs and errors in the software.
testing helps in knowing the cases where a particular application is most likely to fail. 
Quality Assurance: Ensures the software meets quality standards.
To meet the product qualities, if an application works with other related applications then it must undergo compatibility testing. 
Risk Mitigation: Reduces the risk of software failures in production.
Customer Satisfaction: Ensures the software fulfills user requirements and expectations.
